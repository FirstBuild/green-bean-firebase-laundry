This contains some sample code to listen to a laundry machine and then push that status change into FireBase.


#### Get started

Edit machine-status.js with your firebase_email, firebase_password, and change the firebase_sandbox if you see fit.

Connect to raspberry pi, then run:

```
git clone https://github.com/firstbuild/green-bean-firebase-laundry
cd green-bean-firebase-laundry
npm install
node machine-status.js
```
